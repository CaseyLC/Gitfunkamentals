# git init
The ` git init` command is used to create and empty git repository
If you wanted to creat a new directory and intitialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./stauts.md),
[add](./add.md),
[commit](./commit.md),
[push](./commit.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all conten, including directories
